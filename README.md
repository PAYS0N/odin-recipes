HTML and CSS documents for a mock recipe website. Not yet pretty but getting better every day, and great for learning.

I learned basic HTML to create pages and link them. I learned the basic types of boxes available and methods to mark components for CSS. I added some classes and made slight changes to make the site work better with CSS. The CSS aspects I have learned are the basics coloring, block placement, and how to manipulate margin, border, and padding.

Todo:
Update main links to be in a Flex box type
Switch from opening in new tab to same tab, and add back button
Create new color palette and modify homepage (goal is to make pretty but very difficult)
